<h1 class="center">About</h1>

I am a software engineer living in the San Francisco Bay Area and working in video transcoding at [Twitch](https://twitch.tv). In my spare time I try to get out of the city as much as possible and explore California, North America, and the world.

I am originally from Canada and I try to set some time aside to explore my home country on my travel schedule. This generally means a trip to Banff National Park and the Canadian Rockies and this is why you will see a lot of pictures from that part of the world on my website.

Among others, there are a few things I enjoy shooting. Every spring, I travel to the United States Midwest to photograph storms and lightning and to hopefully catch a few tornadoes on my way there. And in recent years, with the solar cycle picking up, I've been trying to travel to more Northern latitudes and capture the Northern Lights.

Feel free to connect with me using the social media links at the bottom of the page. Please note that for professional inquiries (tech recruiting) I receive _a lot_ of mail and as such it is impossible for me to reply to everything and I stick to offers in which I'm interested.

## My photography gear

* The **Nikon D850** is my main camera, that I always carry on photography trips.
* The **Nikon Z6** is a ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù camera, but that is great when hiking, travelling light, or shooting video.
* The **Nikon D500** is more of a ‚Äúspecialized‚Äù camera that I generally take only for wildlife photography.

Onwards to lenses...

* The **ZEISS Milvus 18mm f/2.8 ZF.2** is my primary landscape lens.
* The **Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 24mm f/1.8G ED** offers a narrower FOV, is great for astrophotography, and produces great sunstars.
* The **Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 35mm f/1.8G ED** (the full-frame version) is light and great for not-so-wide landscape photography.
* The **Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G** is a lens that I don't use so much anymore, but everyone needs a nifty fifty, don't they?
* The **Nikon NIKKOR Z 24-70mm f/2.8 S** is a phenomenal all-around lens that I pair with the Nikon Z6 when travelling light.
* The **Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 70-200mm f/2.8G ED VR II** is a great lens for telephoto landscapes, but it's a bit heavy to carry around.
* The **AF-S NIKKOR 300mm f/4E PF ED VR** is a small but powerful prime telephoto that I almost exclusively pair with the Nikon D500 for wildlife photography.

### Prints, workshops, etc.

At this stage it's pretty rare that I get asked for products or services that I sell, but since I am a Canadian living in the United States on a work permit, it's very difficult from a legal standpoint to receive any income other than from my job. This means I sell no courses, no tutorials, no prints, no calendars, and no NFTs. But that last one I can always negotiate üòâ
